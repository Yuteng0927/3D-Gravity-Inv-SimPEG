# 3D-Gravity-Inv-SimPEG

## Summary
This is a practice project, aiming to construct subsurface 3D density model using geophysical gravity data and the open source package [SimPEG](https://simpeg.xyz/). 

## Contents
The input files

- grav.obs: observed gravity data.

- mesh.txt: model discretization or parameterization.

- topo.txt: topography.

The output file

- model_dens.txt: recovered density model.

## Usage

To run the script locally, you need to have python installed, [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is recommended.

- Install SimPEG. 
```
conda install SimPEG --channel conda-forge
```
or
```
pip install SimPEG

```
