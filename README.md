## Summary
This is a practice project, aiming to construct subsurface 3D density model using geophysical gravity data and the open source package [SimPEG](https://simpeg.xyz/). 

## Contents


## Usage

To run the script locally, you need to have python installed, [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is recommended.

- Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Or, set up working environment using conda:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sparse-environment
```

- Install a modified version of SimPEG. Xiaolong made a few changes, yet haven't pull request so far.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/xiaolongw1223/simpeg.git@Joinv_0.13.0_gzz --upgrade --user
```

## Running the code

Download the code and unzip the file,

- In an IPython console

      run MixedLpInversion.py Input.json

- In a command terminal

      $ python MixedLpInversion.py Input.json

## Issues

Please [make an issue](https://github.com/xiaolongw1223/2020-GP-recovering-sparse-models/issues) if you encounter any problems while trying to run the notebooks.
